# Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Project: Train a AI how to run through a random maze

## Run
To run the game, executes in the Final Project folder:

```python
python gameClassFinal.py
```

This will run the agent. The Deep neural network can be customized in the file DQNFinal.py.
To run the pre-trained agent, uncomment line 21 in DQN.py, so that the network loads the weights for the neural network. In case you want to train your own network, leave it as it is.

In gameClassFinal.py you can set *display_option* = True and *speed* = 50, if you want to see the game running.
